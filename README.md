# Neighborhood map of Antwerp

This application presents a map of Antwerp with different points of interest.

One can obtain more information about each place by clicking on the marker on
the map or by clicking on the name of the place in the list.
It is also possible to search among the places by name by using the
input field in the top-left corner.

## How to run the application

Due to the restrictions of the API key, the app can be tested on
[Github Pages](http://wvl-udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood).
